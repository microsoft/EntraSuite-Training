# üîê Privileged Access

Dynamic privileged access management is achievable through Agentic AI‚Äôs ability to assess risk and context in real time. The AI can grant or revoke privileged access based on behavioral analytics, session monitoring, and threat intelligence. Risk-based controls ensure that elevated permissions are only available when necessary and are tightly monitored to prevent misuse.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Deployment Challenges

- Complex integration with existing privileged access management (PAM) tools and legacy systems.
- Resistance from IT staff to new controls or perceived loss of autonomy.
- Difficulty in defining and maintaining dynamic access policies for various scenarios.
- Insufficient real-time monitoring or alerting capabilities in current environments.
- Challenges in scaling privileged access controls across hybrid or multi-cloud architectures.
