# ðŸ§¾ Access Attestation

Agentic AI can automate periodic access reviews by continuously monitoring user activity and access patterns. The AI can flag anomalies or inconsistencies for human review, reducing the burden on IT teams and supporting compliance requirements. Automated reminders and workflow orchestration enable timely and accurate attestation cycles, promoting a culture of accountability.

## Ideas To Explore

* AI-prioritized attestation cycles focusing on high-risk users or sensitive systems first.
* Continuous micro-attestation, rather than bulk periodic reviews, driven by activity patterns.
* Natural language explanations for attestation recommendations to improve reviewer understanding.
* Automated evidence collection and suggestion of remediation actions for non-compliance.

## Known Deployment Challenges

* Review fatigue among managers and reviewers due to bulk, infrequent attestation cycles.
* Difficulty correlating access reviews with real-time user activity and business context.
* Lack of automated evidence collection, leading to time-consuming manual checks.
* Complexity in managing exceptions and remediation actions for non-compliance findings.
* Limited support for natural language explanations of attestation recommendations.
