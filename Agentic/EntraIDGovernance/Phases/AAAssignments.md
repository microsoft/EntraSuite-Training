# üîÑ Automatic Access Assignments

With Agentic AI, access assignments can be automated through intelligent role recommendations and dynamic policy enforcement. The AI can analyze user attributes, job functions, and historical data to suggest optimal access profiles, reducing the risk of over-provisioning or privilege creep. Policy violations can be detected and remediated in real time, ensuring that access assignments remain aligned with organizational requirements.
