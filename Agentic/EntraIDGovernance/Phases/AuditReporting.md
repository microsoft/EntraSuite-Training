# ðŸ“‹ Audit and Reporting

Customers implementing Entra ID Governance solutions have a broad set of auditing and reporting needs to ensure regulatory compliance, maintain security, and provide transparency across identity management processes. They require real-time, comprehensive audit trails that capture user activities, access changes, and policy enforcement actions. Business units and auditors often need customizable dashboards and reporting templates tailored to their specific compliance and operational requirements. Additionally, organizations face the challenge of aggregating audit logs from disparate systems, correlating events across hybrid environments, and delivering actionable insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Agentic AI can significantly enhance these deployments by automating evidence gathering, enabling natural language query interfaces for non-technical users, and leveraging advanced analytics to detect anomalous behaviors or policy violations proactively. By integrating AI-driven insights with Entraâ€™s audit data, organizations can streamline compliance reporting, reduce manual effort, and improve the overall effectiveness of their identity governance programs.
