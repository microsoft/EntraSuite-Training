# ♻️ Lifecycle Automation

Lifecycle automation in identity governance is achieved through Entra Lifecycle Workflows, which enable organizations to automate user onboarding, role changes, and offboarding processes. By integrating with HR and project management systems, Entra Lifecycle Workflows can automatically detect employee status changes and trigger corresponding access provisioning or deprovisioning actions across all connected systems. This ensures that users receive timely and consistent access aligned with their roles, while also reducing manual intervention and the risk of errors. AI and Agentic AI further accelerate deployment and operational efficiency by proactively identifying lifecycle events, suggesting remediation actions for compliance issues, and automating evidence collection for audits. These intelligent capabilities help streamline workflow configuration, adapt processes to evolving business needs, and minimize the administrative burden on IT and security teams, ultimately improving security and compliance outcomes.
