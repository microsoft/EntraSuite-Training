## Introduction

The rapid evolution of digital ecosystems requires organizations to adopt advanced solutions for managing identities, access, and compliance. This report outlines brainstorming efforts to leverage Agentic AI for enhancing customer deployment of Entra Suite capabilities. Our goal is to explore how Agentic AI—autonomous, goal-driven artificial intelligence—can revolutionize traditional IGA processes, making them more agile, secure, and user-centric.

Agentic AI refers to AI systems capable of independent decision-making, proactive task execution, and continuous adaptation based on real-time feedback. When integrated with IGA, Agentic AI has the potential to automate routine tasks, enhance user experience, and strengthen security controls, all while supporting compliance requirements.
