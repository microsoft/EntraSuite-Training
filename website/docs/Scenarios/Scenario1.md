# Streamline employee and guest onboarding

> Secure and governed access to all applications and resources

## Introduction

In this guide, we describe how to configure Microsoft Entra Suite products for a scenario in which the fictional organization, Contoso, wants to hire new remote employees and provide them with secure and seamless access to necessary apps and resources.
They want to invite and collaborate with external users (such as partners, vendors, or customers) and provide them with access to relevant apps and resources. 

Contoso uses Microsoft Entra Verified ID to issue and verify digital proofs of identity and status for new remote employees (based on human resources data) and external users (based on email invitations). Digital wallets store identity proof and status to allow access to apps and resources. As an additional security measure, Contoso may verify identity with FaceCheck facial recognition based on the picture that the credential stores.

They use Microsoft Entra ID Governance to create and grant access packages for employees and external users based on verifiable credentials. 

For employees, they base access packages on job function and department or Lifecycle workflows. Access packages include cloud and on-premises apps and resources to which employees need access.


For external collaborators, they base access packages on based on invitation to define external user roles and permissions. The access packages include only apps and resources to which external users need access.

Employees and external users can request access packages through a self-service portal and provide their digital proofs as identity verification. With single sign-on and multifactor authentication, employees and external users use Microsoft Entra accounts to access apps and resources that their access packages include. Contoso verifies credentials and grants access packages without requiring manual approvals or provisioning.

Contoso uses Microsoft Entra Identity Protection and Conditional Access (CA) to monitor and protect accounts from risky sign-ins and user behavior. They enforce appropriate access controls based on location, device, and risk level

## Configure prerequisites

To successfully deploy and test the solution, configure the prerequisites that we describe in this section.

## Create lifecycle workflows

In this section, we describe how to create joiner and leaver workflows and run workflows on demand.

### Create joiner workflow

To create a joiner workflow, follow these steps.
1.	Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center with at least a Lifecycle Workflows Administrator role.
2.	Go to **Identity governance > Lifecycle workflows > Create a workflow**.
3.	For **Choose a workflow**, select **Onboard new hire employee**.

![image 11](../images/LCW1.png)

4.	For **Basics**, enter Onboard New hire employee â Finance for the workflow display name and description. Select **Next**.
5.	For **Configure scope > Rule**, enter values for **Property, Operator, and Value**. Change the expression of the scope to only users where **Property > department** has a Value of Finance. Ensure that your test user populates **Property** with the Finance string so that itâs in the workflow scope

![image 12](../images/LCW2.png)

6.	On **Review tasks**, select **Add task** to add a task to the template. For this scenario, we add **Request user access package assignment.**
7.	For **Basics**, select **Request user access package assignment**. Assign a name to this task (such as Assign Finance Access Package). Select a policy.
8.	In **Configure**, select the access package that you previously created.
9.	**Optional:** Add other joiner tasks as follows. For some of these tasks, ensure that important attributes such as **Manager** and **Email** are properly mapped to users as described in . [Automate employee onboarding tasks before their first day of work using Lifecycle Workflows APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/tutorial-lifecycle-workflows-onboard-custom-workflow?tabs=http#prerequisites). 

	* Enable User Account
	* Add user to groups or teams
	 Send Welcome Email
	* Generate TAP and Send Email 
10.	Select **Enable Schedule.**

![image 13](../images/LCW3.png)

11.	Select **Review + create.**

### Create leaver workflow (Optional)

To create a leaver workflow, follow these steps.

1.	Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center with at least a Lifecycle Workflows Administrator role.
2.	Go to **Identity governance > Lifecycle workflows > Create a workflow.**
3.	On **Choose a workflow**, select **Offboard an employee.**

![image 14](../images/LCW4.png)

4.	On **Basics**, enter Offboard an employee â Finance as display name and description for the workflow. Select **Next.**
5.	On **Configure scope > Rule**, enter values for **Property, Operator**, and **Value**. Change the expression of the scope to only users where Property > department has a **Value** of **Finance**. Ensure that your test user populates **Property** with the Finance string so that itâs in the workflow scope.

![image 15](../images/LCW5.png)

6.	On **Review tasks**, select **Add task** to add a task to the template. For this scenario we add **Request user access package assignment.**
7.	**Optional:** Add other leaver tasks such as:
	* Disable User Account
	* Remove user from all groups
	* Remove user from all Teams 
8.	Toggle on **Enable schedule.**

![image 16](../images/LCW6.png)

**Note:** Lifecycle workflows run automatically based on defined triggers that combine time-based attributes and an offset value. For example, if the attribute is **employeeHireDate** and offsetInDays is -1, then the workflow should trigger one day before the employee hire date. The value can range between -180 and 180 days. The values **employeeHireDate** and **employeeLeaveDateTime** must be set within Microsoft Entra ID for users. [How to synchronize attributes for Lifecycle workflows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/how-to-lifecycle-workflow-sync-attributes) provides more information on attributes and processes.

### Run joiner workflow on demand

To test this scenario without waiting for the automated schedule, run on-demand lifecycle workflows.
1.	Initiate the previously created joiner workflow.
2.	Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center with at least a Lifecycle Workflows Administrator role.
3.	Go to **Identity governance > Lifecycle workflows > Workflows.**
4.	On **Workflow**, select Onboard New hire employee â Finance that you previously created.
5.	Select **Run on-demand.**
6.	On **Select users**, select **Add users.**
7.	On **Add users**, select the users for which you want to run the on-demand workflow.
8.	Select **Add.**
9.	Confirm your choices. Select **Run workflow.**
10.	Select **Workflow history** to verify task status.

![image 17](../images/LCW7.png)

11.	After all tasks complete, verify that the user has access to the applications that you selected in the access package. This completes the joiner scenario for the user to access necessary apps on day one.

## Review Existing Entra ID Protection Reports

![image 18](../images/id-protection-dash.png)

It's important to review the ID Protection reports before deploying risk-based Conditional Access policies. This review gives an opportunity to investigate any existing suspicious behavior. You might choose to dismiss the risk or confirm these users as safe if you determine they aren't at risk

- [Investigate risk detections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk)
- [Remediate risks and unblock users](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock)
- [Make bulk changes using Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-graph-api)

## Create sign-in risk-based CA policy

1.	Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center with at least a Conditional Access (CA) Administrator role.
2.	Go to **Protection > Conditional Access**.
3.	Select **New policy**.
4.	Enter a **policy name** such as Protect applications for remote high-risk sign-in users.
5.	For **Assignments**, select **Users**.
6.	For **Include**, select a **remote user group** or **select all users**.
7.	For **Exclude**, select **Users and groups**. Select your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts.
8.	Select **Done**.
9.	For **Cloud apps or actions> Include**, select the application(s) to target this policy.
10.	For **Conditions > Sign-in risk**, set **Configure** to **Yes**. For **Select the sign-in risk level this policy will apply to**, select **High and Medium**.
11.	Select **Done**.
12.	For **Access controls > Grant**.
13.	Select **Grant access > Require multifactor authentication**.
14.	For **Session**, select **Sign-in frequency**. Select **Every time**.
15.	Confirm settings. Select **Enable policy**
	- For more information visit the following article about [Configuring and enabling risk policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies)

	![image 9](../images/VID-09.png) 

16. **Optional:** ID Protection sends risk signals to Conditional Access, to make decisions and enforce organization policies. These policies might require users perform multifactor authentication or secure password change. Consider the following:
	- Policy exclusions
		- [Emergency access or break-glass](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/security-emergency-access) accounts to prevent lockout due to policy misconfiguration. In the unlikely scenario all administrators are locked out, your emergency-access administrative account can be used to log in and take steps to recover access.
		- Service accounts and Service principals, such as the Microsoft Entra Connect Sync Account. Service accounts are non-interactive accounts that aren't tied to any particular user. They're normally used by back-end services allowing programmatic access to applications, but are also used to sign in to systems for administrative purposes. Calls made by service principals won't be blocked by Conditional Access policies scoped to users. Use Conditional Access for workload identities to define policies targeting service principals.
			- If your organization has these accounts in use in scripts or code, consider replacing them with [managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).
	- Multifactor Authentication
		- For users to self-remediate risk though, they must register for [Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted) before they become risky.
	- Known network locations
		- It's important to configure [named locations in Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-assignment-network#how-are-these-locations-defined) and add your VPN ranges to [Defender for Cloud Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/ip-tags#create-an-ip-address-range). Sign-ins from named locations that are marked as trusted or known, improve the accuracy of ID Protection risk calculations. These sign-ins lower a user's risk when they authenticate from a location marked as trusted or known. This practice reduces false positives for some detections in your environment.

## Request access package
After you configure an access package with a Verified ID requirement, end-users who are within the scope of the policy can request access in their **My Access** portal. While reviewing requests for approval, approvers can see the claims of the verified credentials that requestors present.
1.	As a remote user or guest, sign in to **myaccess.microsoft.com*.
2.	Search for the access package that you previously created (such as Finance Apps for Remote Users). You can browse the listed packages or use the search bar. Select **Request**.
3.	The system displays an information banner with a message such as, To request access to this access package you need to present your Verifiable Credentials. Select **Request Access**. Scan the QR Code with your phone to launch Microsoft Authenticator. Share your credentials.
	
	![image 10](../images/VID-10.png)

4.	After you share your credentials, continue with the approval workflow.
5.	**Optional**: Simulate user risk by following these instructions: [Simulating risk detections in Microsoft Entra ID Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-simulate-risk). You may need to try multiple times to raise the user risk to medium or high.
6.	Try accessing the application that you previously created for the scenario to confirm blocked access. You may need to wait up to one hour for block enforcement.
7.	Validate that access is blocked by the Conditional Access (CA) policy that you created earlier using sign-in logs. Open non-interactive sign in logs from the ZTNA Network Access Client Private application. View logs from the Private Access application name that you previously created as the **Resource name**.
8. [Enable email notifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-notifications) so you can respond when a user is flagged as a risk. These notifications allow you to start investigating immediately. You can also set up weekly digest emails giving you an overview of risk for that week.
9. The [Impact analysis of risk-based access policies workbook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/workbook-risk-based-policy-impact) helps administrators understand user impact before creating risk-based Conditional Access policies.
The [ID Protection workbook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/workbook-risk-analysis) can help monitor and look for patterns in your tenant. Monitor this workbook for trends and also Conditional Access Report Only mode results to see if there are any changes that need to be made, for example, additions to named locations.
You can also use the ID Protection APIs to [export risk information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-export-risk-data) to other tools, so your security team can monitor and alert on risk events.
